    /// The SACK option is to be sent by a data receiver to inform the data sender of non-contiguous blocks of data that have been received and queued.  
    /// The data receiver awaits the receipt of data (perhaps by means of retransmissions) to fill the gaps in sequence space between received blocks.  
    /// When missing segments are received, the data receiver acknowledges the data normally by advancing 
    /// the left window edge in the Acknowledgement Number Field of the TCP header.  
    /// The SACK option does not change the meaning of the Acknowledgement Number field.
    /// 
    /// This option contains a list of some of the blocks of contiguous sequence space occupied by data that has been received and queued within the window.
    /// Each contiguous block of data queued at the data receiver is defined in the SACK option by two 32-bit unsigned integers in network byte order:
    /// *    Left Edge of Block - This is the first sequence number of this block.
    /// *    Right Edge of Block - This is the sequence number immediately following the last sequence number of this block.
    /// 
    /// Each block represents received bytes of data that are contiguous and isolated; 
    /// that is, the bytes just below the block, (Left Edge of Block - 1), and just above the block, (Right Edge of Block), have not been received.
    /// 
    /// A SACK option that specifies n blocks will have a length of 8*n+2 bytes, so the 40 bytes available for TCP options can specify a maximum of 4 blocks.
    /// It is expected that SACK will often be used in conjunction with the Timestamp option used for RTTM [Jacobson92], 
    /// which takes an additional 10 bytes (plus two bytes of padding); thus a maximum of 3 SACK blocks will be allowed in this case.
    /// 
    /// The SACK option is advisory, in that, while it notifies the data sender that the data receiver has received the indicated segments,
    /// the data receiver is permitted to later discard data which have been reported in a SACK option.
